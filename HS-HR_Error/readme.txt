--README--

Yo! Thanks for downloading! Error is a ghost designed to interact with the user. He's pretty prickly, but he'll warm up to you eventually. He'll sit around on your desktop randomly complaining or rambling. You can toggle the frequency of his talking his menu, using right-click.

Pet his head, scarf, or hands to get a response from him. You can also dress him up with various accessories and give him items to interact with. 

Double-click on his body to open his interaction menu. You can perform an ACTion or ask him a question to chat.

Error's hostage/friend, Blue (Underswap Sans) is also here to hang out! He's a lot nicer than Error and could really use some friendly company. He will appear randomly and can be asked to go away after being summoned.
